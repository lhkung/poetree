戲筆
楊萬里

野菊荒苔各鑄錢
金黃銅綠兩爭妍
天公支予窮詩客
只買清愁不買田


Wild mums and moss span like minted coins. 
Mums glitter like gold and moss like bronze.
Bestowed by Heaven to poets poor,
they buy sorrow but not fields.  


竹枝歌
楊萬里

月子彎彎照九州
幾家歡樂幾家愁
愁殺人來關月事
得休休處且休休
As the crescent Moon upon the land shines,
some homes merry, some wretched are.
The Moon has nothing to do with human sorrow.
Where one must let go, one must let go.


道旁竹
楊萬里

竹竿穿竹籬
却與籬為柱
大小只相依
榮枯何足顧
Through the bamboo fence grows a bamboo culm.
The culm is propped up by the fence.
So long as they support each other,
does it matter to be dead or alive?


虞美人
蔣捷

少年聽雨歌樓上
紅燭昏羅帳
壯年聽雨客舟中
江闊雲低
斷雁叫西風
而今聽雨僧廬下
鬢已星星也
悲歡離合總無情
一任階前
點滴到天明
