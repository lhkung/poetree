戲筆
楊萬里

野菊荒苔各鑄錢
金黃銅綠兩爭妍
天公支予窮詩客
只買清愁不買田


Wild mums and moss span like minted coins. 
Mums glitter like gold and moss like bronze.
Bestowed by Heaven to poets poor,
they buy sorrow but not fields.  


竹枝歌
楊萬里

月子彎彎照九州
幾家歡樂幾家愁
愁殺人來關月事
得休休處且休休
As the crescent Moon upon the land shines,
some homes merry, some wretched are.
The Moon has nothing to do with human sorrow.
Where one must let go, one must let go.


道旁竹
楊萬里

竹竿穿竹籬
却與籬為柱
大小只相依
榮枯何足顧
Through the bamboo fence grows a bamboo culm.
The culm is propped up by the fence.
So long as they support each other,
does it matter to be dead or alive?


虞美人
蔣捷

少年聽雨歌樓上
紅燭昏羅帳
壯年聽雨客舟中
江闊雲低
斷雁叫西風
而今聽雨僧廬下
鬢已星星也
悲歡離合總無情
一任階前
點滴到天明
In my youth I listened to the rain in a song-house,
where curtains were lit by candles dim. 
In my prime years I listened to the rain on a traveller's boat,
drifting on a river wide, capped by low-lying clouds.  
A lone goose against the west wind cried.

The sound of rain I now observe in a monk's cottage.
My temple hair has grown grey.
Sorrow, joy, parting, reunion. How ruthless they are!
Nothing to do but let the rain dribble on the stair,
drop by drop until dawn.



君不見黃河之水天上來，奔流到海不復回
君不見高堂明鏡悲白髮，朝如青絲暮成雪
人生得意須盡歡
莫使金樽空對月
天生我材必有用
千金散盡還復來
烹羊宰牛且為樂 
會須一飲三百杯
岑夫子，丹丘生，將進酒，杯莫停
與君歌一曲，請君為我傾耳聽
鐘鼓饌玉不足貴，但願長醉不願醒
古來聖賢皆寂寞，唯有飲者留其名
陳王昔時宴平樂，斗酒十千恣歡謔
主人何為言少錢，徑須沽取對君酌
五花馬，千金裘 
呼兒將出換美酒，與爾同銷萬古愁。
